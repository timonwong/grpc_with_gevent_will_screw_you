# Demonstrate that using grpc with gevent will screw you.

## Run

At first, please create a virtualenv and then issue `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In order to run the grpc server:

```bash
./run_server.py
```

See a normal grpc client, use native threading:

```bash
./run_client_threading.py
```

The following will just screw you:

```bash
./run_client_gevent.py
```

## Results

```
$ ./run_client_threading.py
